<p><h2>Mapping the frozen yogurt shop closest to each Manhattan apartment</h2>

<p>I love frozen yogurt. When I first moved to New York three years ago, I lived only 1/8th of a mile from the closest froyo shop. The convenience of this 4-minute walk is something I neither appreciated nor utilized enough at the time.</p><p>After moving to Harlem last year, it’s been harder than ever to satisfy my near-constant craving for this cold candy soup — I’m now a 24-minute walk to the nearest frozen yogurt.</p><p>As someone who loves data and has too much time to spare, I decided to find the locations in Manhattan with highest and lowest froyo densitiy. Inspired by Ben Wellington's work on <a href="http://iquantny.tumblr.com/">I Quant NY</a>, I calculated the distance from every lot in Manhattan to the nearest froyo shop <a href="https://brianweinstein.cartodb.com/viz/27dd05e0-2486-11e6-98ba-0e98b61680bf/embed_map">and mapped it out</a>.</p>

<p>The highest density of froyo is right around West 33rd St. and 8th Ave., with three shops within a 1-block radius. The lowest density is right in Harlem. The red circle on the map shows the location farthest from frozen yogurt. The record belongs to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/BYaDA85FGH52">700 Esplanade Gardens Plaza</a>, a co-op right by the 145th St. stop on the 3-train, with a 51-minute trek across Manhattan to the Pinkberry by Columbia.</p><p><a href="https://brianweinstein.cartodb.com/viz/27dd05e0-2486-11e6-98ba-0e98b61680bf/embed_map">The map</a> shows all of the froyo shops in Manhattan, and you can click on any lot to find the distance to the closest shop.</p><p><small></small></p>

<small><small><ul><li>All distances in the map are measured using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance">great-circle distance</a> (i.e., ”<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_the_crow_flies">as the crow flies</a>”), according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines#Law_of_cosines_in_non-Euclidean_geometry">law of cosines</a>.<br></li><li>Frozen yogurt locations were found via the <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search">Google Places Nearby Search API</a>. The API returned some non-froyo-exclusive shops like Ben and Jerry’s, which I kept in the dataset since they technically serve some frozen yogurt (although we all know these shops don’t <i>really</i> count).<br></li><li>I only included froyo shops that were in Manhattan, so some lots may have a closer shop than the one listed if we include those in other boroughs.<br></li><li>Manhattan lot locations are from <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page">PLUTO</a>.<br></li><li>The map was created using <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a>.<br></li><li>Tons of inspiration for this came from Ben Wellington's work on <a href="http://iquantny.tumblr.com/">I Quant NY</a>.</li></ul></small></small></p>
